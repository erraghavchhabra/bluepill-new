I don't want something that looks like my mom's vitamins. Image 2 with the fruit is trying too hard, looks like some influencer 'wellness' junk. Image 3 with the box is too serious, too corporate. Image 4 is a blurry mess, hard pass. Image 1 is clean. It's got a modern, minimalist vibe, kinda like a cool tech product. The frosted bottle and wood cap are a nice touch. It looks straightforward, no BS. It's the one that matches my 'vibe' without making me feel like I'm buying into some lame health fad. It's simple, looks effective, and I can just add it to my cart and move on.",

When I see these options, Image 2 immediately stands out. The pops of color from the flower and fruits are so pretty and cheerful. It makes the product feel natural and wholesome, which I value. It suggests it's made from good things. Image 1 is too plain, and Image 3 with the box is nice and looks professional, but Image 2 has that 'Pinterest-worthy' aesthetic I love. It makes taking a supplement feel like a little act of self-care, not a chore. I would definitely be more drawn to click on this one.",
